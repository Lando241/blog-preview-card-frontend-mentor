### What I learned

Simple Blog preview card. The biggest thing learned with building this project was being able to utilize Figma to assist with making the correct style choices.

### Continued development

Looking forward to implementing more styles from Figma. Would also like more practice with SVG's as I had issues with sizing the SVG to the proper proportions.

### Useful resources

- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - Helped in understanding the proper sizes for fonts, gaps, padding and margin.
